openepoc
========

A few open source ML libraries for emotiv's EPOC. The goal is to create a high level Python API to allow developers to train high level digital controls from EPOC data and use these controls in their applications.  
Depends on <a href="https://github.com/qdot/emokit">qdot's emokit</a>. Modified qdot's python interface to the EPOC, and included the modified version.

You will need to install fftw3 (http://www.fftw.org/index.html) with
`./configure --enable-float`
